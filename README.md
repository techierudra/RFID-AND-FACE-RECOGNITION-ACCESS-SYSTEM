# RFID AND FACE RECOGNITION ACCESS SYSTEM USING RASPBERRY PI
1. Hardware Components:
● RFID Readers: These devices are responsible for reading RFID tags or cards carried
by individuals to identify them uniquely. RFID readers are connected to the Raspberry
Pi via GPIO pins or USB ports.
● Cameras: High-resolution cameras are employed to capture facial images of
individuals. These cameras are interfaced with the Raspberry Pi to enable facial
recognition.
● Raspberry Pi: Acting as the central processing unit, the Raspberry Pi executes the
access management software, interfaces with hardware components, and
communicates with external databases or cloud platforms.
2. System Workflow:
● RFID Authentication: When individuals enter the premises, they are required to swipe
their RFID tags/cards near the RFID readers. The RFID module captures the tag
information and verifies it against the database to authenticate the individual's identity.
● Facial Recognition: Simultaneously, the camera captures facial images of individuals
within the vicinity. The Facial Recognition module processes these images to perform
facial recognition, matching them against the stored facial templates.
● access Logging: Upon successful authentication through RFID and/or facial
recognition, the system logs the access of individuals in the database, along with
relevant timestamps.
● Reporting and Integration: access records can be retrieved from the database for
generating reports or integrated with existing access management systems for further
analysis and processing.
